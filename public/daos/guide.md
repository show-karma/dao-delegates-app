## For Tokenholders

Tokenholders and the community can access real-time insights into delegate activity across platforms like Snapshot, On-Chain voting, Forum, Discord, and other systems via this dashboard. This promotes transparency and better decision-making in the DAO.

If you're interested in delegating your tokens, utilize the various filtering features to refine your options, identify suitable candidates, and delegate your tokens accordingly.

### How-to delegate tokens

Several DAOs employ Karma's scoring system to quantify delegate activity with weighted scores, allowing the community to assess delegate performance and engagement. These scores are tailored to the specific DAO, and we collaborate with the DAO to determine the appropriate weights and metrics for calculating the scores.
