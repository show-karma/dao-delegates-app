# dYdX contributor dashboard

---

The dYdX contributor dashboard displays all the contributors of the DAO and their activity across Snapshot, On-chain voting, Forum and Discord. You can find answers to the most common questions below.

**1. How do I add myself to this dashboard?**

Click the Login button in the menu above and login with your wallet. Complete your profile and link your social handles. After a few minutes, your profile along with stats will be displayed.

**2. How is my score calculated?**

We worked with the dYdX team and came up with weights for each metric. You can click on your score to see all the metrics, weights and the formula used to get the score.

**3. My forum score is blank**

Please make sure that the wallet you use to login to the [Forum](https://forums.dydx.community/overview) is same as the one used for voting.

Join dYdX Discord server and go to the [support channel](https://discord.com/channels/724804754382782534/953825156374085692). Type the following command to link your Discord handle to your wallet. After a few minutes, your Discord score will be displayed.
