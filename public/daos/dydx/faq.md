# dYdX Contributor Dashboard

---

The dYdX contributor dashboard shows the DAO contributors and their activity on Snapshot, On-chain voting, Forum, and Discord. Find answers to frequently asked questions below.

**1. I can not find my profile in the dashboard.**

If you can't find your profile, click the Login button in the menu and login with your wallet. Complete your profile and link your social handles. After a few minutes, your profile along with stats will be displayed.

**2. How is my score calculated?**

We worked with the dYdX team and came up with weights for each metric. You can click on your score to see all the metrics, weights and the formula used to get the score.

**3. My forum score is blank**

Please make sure that the wallet address you use to login to the <a href="https://forums.dydx.community/overview" target="_blank">CommonWealth Forum</a> is same as the one used for voting. All your activity is linked to a single wallet address on our dashboard.

**4. My Discord score is blank**

You have to link your Discord handle to your wallet address for us to index your Discord activity. To link your handle, join dYdX Discord server and go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/724804754382782534/953825156374085692" target="_blank">support channel</a>. Type the command /karma and select linkwallet and enter your wallet address.
