--summary--What is the difference between a delegate and a Community Delegate?--/summary--

Becoming a delegate is open to anyone, but there is a distinction for Community Delegates. These individuals are verified members of the community who commit to following the Code of Conduct proposed by the community. While delegates have the option to remain anonymous, Community Delegates are required to verify their social handles, confirming their identity in Web2/Web3 platforms. This verification process enhances trust and credibility, as Community Delegates are recognized and trusted members of the community. It promotes transparency and reliability in their role within the governance processes (read more here).

--summary--How to choose a delegate? --/summary--

When choosing a delegate, there are many factors to consider. Deciding which factors are important and how they will factor into your decision is a personal choice. That said, here are somethings to consider:
Read their bios. Expertise and knowledge play a crucial role. Look for delegates who have a deep understanding of the subject matter or industry related to the decision at hand.

Voting history and track record. Consider delegates who have a proven history of acting in the best interests of the community and making sound decisions by looking at the number of times they have previously participated in governance and how they voted.

Transparency and communication are essential as well. Look for delegates who are open and transparent about their decision-making process and regularly communicate with the community they represent via Community Forum.
Accessibility and responsiveness are additional factors to consider. Delegates should be easily reachable and responsive to inquiries or concerns from token holders via indicated channels such as Community Forum or Twitter.

Evaluate the delegate's alignment with your own interests and values. Choose delegates who share similar goals and priorities to ensure that your voice is effectively represented in the decision-making process.

--summary--What are the functions of different tracks?--/summary--

Different tracks in OpenGov serve specific functions and are associated with various types of proposals. Here is a breakdown of each track and its corresponding proposal types:

**Root Track**: This track holds the highest privilege level within OpenGov. It is responsible for handling proposals related to runtime upgrades and the management of the Technical Committee.

**Whitelisted Track**: Proposals in this track require approval from the Technical Committee before being dispatched. Typically, these proposals involve fast-tracked operations.

**General Admin Track**: The General Admin track is designed for general on-chain decision-making. Proposals in this track cover a range of topics such as XCM fees, the Orbiter program, Parachain Staking, and Registrar-related matters.

**Emergency Canceller Track**: The Emergency Canceller track is utilized for canceling incorrect referendums. Proposals in this track involve refunding the decision deposit when a wrong referendum has taken place.

**Emergency Killer Track**: The Emergency Killer track is employed for terminating detrimental referendums. Proposals in this track result in the slashing of the deposit associated with very bad referendums.

These different tracks in OpenGov facilitate efficient and organized decision-making processes based on the specific types of proposals they handle.

--summary--How does a conviction work in OpenGov?--/summary--

When participating in voting for a proposal, token holders have the option to select a "conviction" level linked to their vote. The conviction reflects the level of dedication the token holder has towards their decision. This conviction system works by locking the tokens for a specific duration determined by the chosen conviction level. The longer the lock duration, the more weight their vote has.

--summary--How long will my tokens be locked if I delegate them?--/summary--

The duration for which your tokens will be locked when delegated depends on the "conviction lock" selected during the delegation process. If you select a 1x conviction, for example, your tokens will remain in lock for a period equivalent to that. It is important to note that the lock duration is independent of the conviction selected by your delegate. Furthermore, undelegating your voting power does not immediately grant you access to your tokens. Access to tokens is only restored after the chosen conviction lock period has expired and the unlocking procedure has been completed.
