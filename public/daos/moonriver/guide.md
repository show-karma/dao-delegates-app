### About

This delegate dashboard is a user-friendly platform designed to enhance delegation-based activities in Moonriver and Moonbeam. It offers various features, including delegate onboarding, pitching, social handle verification, and advanced sorting options. Additionally, there is a custom scoring system to quantify delegate activities, fostering transparency and informed decision-making. 

### Community Delegates

Community Delegates are individuals or groups entrusted with voting power by token holders to advocate on their behalf. They serve as representatives of the community, acting as a voice for token holders in the decision-making process. By delegating their voting power, token holders empower delegates to actively participate in governance and make informed decisions that align with their interests and values.

### Tokenholders

Tokenholders and the community members can access real-time insights into delegate activity across platforms like Snapshot, On-Chain voting, Discourse, Discord, and other systems via this dashboard. This promotes transparency and better decision-making in the Moonriver/Moonbeam governance.
If you're interested in delegating your tokens, utilize the various filtering features to refine your options, identify suitable candidates, and delegate your tokens accordingly.
