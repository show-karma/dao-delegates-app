## About

This delegate dashboard is a user-friendly platform designed to enhance delegation-based activities in a DAO for delegates, tokenholders, and community members by providing features such as delegate onboarding, pitching, social handle verification, and advanced sorting options. Additionally, there is a custom, DAO-controlled scoring system to quantify delegate activities, fostering transparency and informed decision-making.

## For Delegates

Delegates can onboard themselves, create a pitch, and verify their social handles to improve trustworthiness within the community.

### How to become a delegate

1. Click the **Login** button on the top right corner of the page and log in through your wallet.
2. Create a pitch, explaining the reasons you want to be a delegate.
3. Verify your social handles and connect them to your Karma profile.
4. We will start indexing your data and surfacing stats within a day of creating your profile.

## For Tokenholders

Tokenholders and the community can access real-time insights into delegate activity across platforms like Snapshot, On-Chain voting, Forum, Discord, and other systems via this dashboard. This promotes transparency and better decision-making in the DAO.

If you're interested in delegating your tokens, utilize the various filtering features to refine your options, identify suitable candidates, and delegate your tokens accordingly.

### How to delegate tokens

1. If you know the delegate ENS name or address, enter the address in the search box.
2. Use the **Status** dropdown to check if the delegate has been active in the DAO.
3. Use the various filtering options to find delegates based on their interests, voting participation, forum participation, and overall score.
4. Once you find a suitable delegate, click the Delegate button. Follow the steps to connect your wallet, verify the tokens you are delegating and confirm.

## Scoring System

Several DAOs employ Karma's scoring system to quantify delegate activity with weighted scores, allowing the community to assess delegate performance and engagement. These scores are tailored to the specific DAO, and we collaborate with the DAO to determine the appropriate weights and metrics for calculating the scores.

## Summary

Karma is a comprehensive platform that streamlines the delegation process and promotes transparency in delegate activities. Its wide range of features and scoring system empowers delegates, tokenholders, and community members to make informed decisions, fostering a more engaged community.
