# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Managing voting power and participation in multiple Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) can be complex and fragmented. This project aims to simplify this process by providing a unified platform for DAO members.

## Problems It Solves

- **Complexity in Delegation**: Different DAOs have varying delegation mechanisms, making it cumbersome for users to delegate their voting power across multiple DAOs.
- **Lack of a Centralized View**: Users often lack a single place to view their delegations, understand their voting power, and discover potential delegates.
- **Onboarding Difficulty**: New DAO participants might find it challenging to understand and engage in governance.

## How It Should Work

The application should allow users to:

1.  Connect their crypto wallet.
2.  Discover supported DAOs.
3.  View information about each DAO, including its governance token, delegation policies, and active delegates.
4.  Delegate their voting power according to the specific DAO's mechanism (e.g., direct delegation, token locking for voting escrow tokens like veRARI).
5.  View and manage their active delegations.
6.  (Potentially) Explore delegate profiles and their voting history.

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface**: The platform should be easy to navigate, even for users new to DAO governance.
- **Secure**: All interactions with user wallets and smart contracts must be secure.
- **Transparent**: Provide clear information about delegation processes, token balances, and voting power.
- **Comprehensive**: Aim to support a growing list of DAOs and their unique delegation models.
