# Project Brief

## Project Name

DAO Delegates Application

## Core Requirements and Goals

The project aims to build an application that facilitates DAO delegation for various DAOs. It should allow users to:

- View different DAOs and their delegates.
- Delegate their voting power to a chosen delegate.
- Manage their delegations.

The application needs to support different delegation mechanisms for different DAOs, such as direct delegation and token locking/conversion (e.g., Rari DAO's RARI to veRARI).
